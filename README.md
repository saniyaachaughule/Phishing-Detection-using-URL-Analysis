## 🧠 Project Goal
To develop a machine learning-based tool that can detect phishing websites using only the URL. This helps in preventing users from falling victim to fraudulent sites.

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Phishing is a deceptive technique used by attackers to trick individuals into providing sensitive data by impersonating trusted websites. These fake websites are commonly distributed via URLs that look legitimate. Manual detection is difficult, and traditional blacklists often fail to detect new phishing links. Our tool provides a machine-learning-based approach to analyze and detect phishing URLs dynamically.

---

## 💡 Features

- Input a URL and get instant prediction (Phishing or Legitimate)
- Trained on a real-world dataset of labeled URLs
- Random Forest classifier for reliable detection
- Simple CLI-based tool
- Cleanly structured Python code

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.11** – Core programming language
- **Scikit-learn** – For training the machine learning model
- **Pandas** – For data manipulation and analysis
- **Joblib** – For saving and loading the trained model

## 🔍 How It Works:

- **Training**: Uses historical data (labeled URLs) to train a machine learning model (Random Forest).

- **Prediction**: Accepts a URL, processes its features, and uses the trained model to predict whether the URL is phishing or legitimate.

- **Tool Output**: Provides real-time results (Phishing or Legitimate) based on the model’s prediction.

- This tool helps users avoid phishing attacks by flagging suspicious URLs before they click on them.
